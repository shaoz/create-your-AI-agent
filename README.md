# Agent: Zero to One

> A hands-on Agent Development Bootcamp from **ThinkInAI Community** and **MemVerge**.
> Build your **first deployable AI Agent** in real-world business scenarios.

## 🚀 Why You Should Join

- **Practice-Driven, Not Conceptual:** Every module is a hands-on project. We skip the abstract theories and focus on what you can build.
- **Real & Reusable Outcomes:** The agents you build are directly applicable to your business or startup ideas.
- **End-to-End Toolchain:** Master a complete stack—from LLM orchestration and long-term memory to workflow automation.

## 🛠️ What You Will Build

| Capability | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Open WebUI**[Open WebUI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) | Build a local/private AI workstation for a controllable and auditable Agent interface. |
| **MemMachine**[MemMachine](https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine) | Equip your agent with long-term memory for continuous learning and context tracing. |
| **LLM APIs** <br/> (DeepSeek / doubao / PPIO, etc.) | Confidently call different models, combining reasoning, generation, and retrieval as needed. |
| **Toolchains & Workflow Orchestration** | Construct scalable, multi-tool, and multi-stage agent processes. |

## ✅ Pre-Course Checklist

Before we begin, please follow the **[Project Launch Checklist](checklist.md)** to set up your environment, install necessary software, and configure API keys. This ensures you can start coding from day one.

- **Build Sprint (2 weeks):** Self-driven development. We suggest building the core in Week 1 and expanding the toolchain for deployment in Week 2.
- **Community Support:** Get real-time technical support and project feedback in the dedicated WeChat group throughout the sprint.

### Weekly Commitment
- **Suggested:** 3-4 focused sessions of ~2 hours each.
- **Flexibility:** All sessions are recorded for flexible learning.

## 👨‍🏫 Instructors & Community Support

### Instructor Team
Core instructors from **ThinkInAI** & the technical team from **MemVerge**, with deep expertise in AI product, engineering, and operations.

### Learning Community
- **WeChat Group:** Daily Q&A and peer review of projects.
- **Resource Library:** A curated collection of development scripts, prompt templates, and deployment guides.

### Student Perks
Outstanding projects will be featured in our official showcase and may lead to internship or co-creation opportunities with partners.

## 🎓 Your Final Portfolio

Upon completion, you will have built and deployed three powerful, reusable agents:

- **Project 1 · AI Writing Assistant:** A partner that truly understands your brand's voice and can continuously learn from your content.
- **Project 2 · AI Health Companion:** A family health assistant that records data, provides reminders, and offers support through long-term interactions.
